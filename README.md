A study tool for students


Encountered Issues:
My music player would not read the mp3 files that were passed in as audio sources, but rather would link back to my index.html file. Im not too sure why this is, I just know it must be something to do with my server settings. For next time developing a site like this, I'll definitely pay more attention to the server side and leave enough time for things that go wrong. 

My music player was meant to be formatted in a way that doesnt allow for skips or progress bars to be seen, as this can be a distraction for students who want to procrastinate. To see the working version, I have my code in replit -> https://StudBud.schoenertag.repl.co
